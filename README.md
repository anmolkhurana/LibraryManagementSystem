# LibraryManagementSystem
JAVA, JDBC, MySql, JAVA APPLETS, JAVA SWINGS,

INTRODUCTION

In this project I have used java to create a library management system. I have created different classes in order to explain
how each of the class is playing an individual role behind the JDBC concept.

FEATURES

This project basically serves to explain the Java JDBC concepts. How one can take input from the user and forward the data to the 
database (MySql) is being shown here practically. This project comprises of Java swing application to create a GUI. The user puts in the 
login name and id so as to authenticate himself/herself. There are various operation that can be performed on the database but here 
I have shown the basic ones (Inser, Delete and View). 

WHY?

In order to understand the concepts of JDBC one has to create a simple project that demonstrates the use of JDBC in today's world. With 
that motivation I started working upon this project. This simple demonstration helped me a lot to understand the concepts of JDBC along with JAVA Applets.

NOTE: DO NOT FORGET TO PUT MYSQL_CONNECTOR.JAR FILE IN LIB FOLDER
